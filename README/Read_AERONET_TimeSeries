# Read AERONET Time-Series

The purpose of this code is to read AERONET data directly from AERONET's web services and to plot time-series graphs to
visualize changes in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) or Angstrom Exponent parameters at specified AERONET sites. Different
parameters can be specified by user such as site name, daily/monthly averages, data level, wavelength, time frame, etc.
The output of the code is 3 plots: time-series graph, tile plot, and calendar plot. The regular time-series graph is
recommended for short-term or medium-term time-series analyses. The recommended data size should be a few months (if using
daily averages) or a few years (if using monthly averages). Anything more than that will produce a cluttered graph. The
tile plot is used for medium to long-term time-series analysis (at least a couple of years, daily or monthly averages).
The calendar plot is also for medium to long-term time-series analysis (daily data only), but it provides a more clear view
of the individual days thanks to its calendar-like structure.

The program was first deployed in July 2023 to assist in tracking the changes in AOD levels of AERONET sites in the eastern
US and Canada, due to the Canadian wildfires. Users also have the opportunity to save and download output plots at the end.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Running this code is straightforward. The only requirements are having the means to run a Python notebook file
(.ipynb). This can be done either in Google Colab (recommended), if the user has a Google account. It can also 
be done locally on Jupyter Notebook, which requires installation of Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/

### Installation

There is a list of libraries that need to be installed before running the code. Those include: beautifulsoup4, requests, 
and calplot. All other libraries used are already installed on Google Colab/Anaconda by default. Note that the exclamation 
point is not required when installing through the Anaconda command prompt.

!pip install beautifulsoup4
!pip install requests
!pip install calplot

The beautifulsoup4 package provides web scraping capabilities, where data from a webpage can be read into "soup" file that 
can be later converted to a dataframe. The requests package is useful for sending HTTP requests using Python, in this case 
to obtain URL of web data. The calplot package can be used to create calendar plots, which are a type of heatmap that displays
time-series data over a conventional calendar year. Those plots are especially useful for long-term time series analysis.

In addition to the packages discussed above, the code also makes use of libraries like shutil, numpy, math, datetime, pandas,
matplotlib, and sklearn. The shutil library was used for creating zip files with the output. Array manipulation was performed
with the numpy library, and time data manipulation was performed with the datetime library. The "math" library provides
access to mathematical functions. The pandas library's purpose was to clean and aggregate data for analysis. Other plots such
as tile plots and time series graphs were created with the matplotlib library. Finally, the sklearn framework was used to fit
trendlines that are less prone to overfitting to extreme/outlier data than the Ordinary Least Squares method.

## Usage

Below are the two cells which require action from the user. The first cell prompts user to allow Google to mount their local
drive onto the colab notebook. The user will need to allow access from the popup window that shows after running that cell. 
It also imports the files library, which enables downloading the output files. After that, it creates a directory where the 
output files are being stored.

### Example 1

from google.colab import files
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/drive')
!mkdir Output_TimeSeries

The second cell prompts the user for input. The list of parameters are name of site, initial and final dates of interest, 
level of data, type of average (daily, hourly), feature choice (AOD or Angstrom exponent), AOD wavelength, and Angstrom 
exponent parameter. Default values have been setup in case a user provides an invalid response. Warnings have been put in 
place in case a user selects a timeframe that is possibly too large for the program to handle. If an URL cannot be generaed 
from the web services, the user is promped to try again.

### Example 2

site = 'Alta_Floresta'                  #Make sure site name is spelled properly
dt_initial = '20010101'                 #starting date YYYYMMDD format
dt_final = '20230728'                   #final date YYYYMMDD format
level = 1.5                             #AERONET data level
average_type = 1                        #daily (1), monthly (2)
feature_choice = 1                      #Enter '1' for AOD wavelength or '2' for Angstrom exponent parameter
wavelength = 500                        #Available choices: 1640, 1020, 870, 865, 779, 675, 667, 620, 560, 555, 551, 532, 531, 510, 500, 490, 443, 440, 412, 400, 380, 340
Angstrom_exp = '440-675'                #Available choices: '440-870','380-500','440-675','500-870','340-440','440-675'

## How It Works

The code initially takes some of the user input parameters from Example 2, and uses them in constructing a URL that resembles
the real link that contains the data with those desired parameters. The URL is converted to a tuple to remove the commas, and
an HTTP request is made from Google Colab to get the text from the real URL using the tuple. If there is a match with the URL,
the beautiful soup package is used to scrape the information from the webpage. That information is saved as a text file and 
then read as a Pandas dataframe. The first few rows are skipped so that only the data and headers remain. The dataframe is 
aggregated and filtered according to the remainder of user input. The dates are converted to datetime format and set as the 
dataframe's index. If monthly averages were selected, data is aggregated by period. Finally, the time series graphs, tile and
calendar plots are displayed. The time series graph shows dates on x-axis and AOD/AE measurements on y-axis. The tile map
represents a mosaic with year on y-axis and daily/monthly average on x-axis. The AOD/AE averages are displayed as a heatmap
on the tile and calendar plots, with a colorbar that conveys the intensity to those measurements. Missing data is displayed 
in white on those plots. The colorbars feature triangular extensions that denote extreme values. The user has the opportunity
to run the code for different sites, so different graphs are generated for each site. If desired, the entire output is saved 
in a zipped folder and then downloaded.

## Extra Features

An annual AOD variability plot is also displayed, but only if the daily average option is selected. The x-axis represents the year,
while the y-axis is the site average AOD for each year. The standard deviation of each year AOD values were computed and
also shown on the graph as the yellow shaded region. A linear trendline was then fitted to the data to show how AOD changes on
average throughout the years.
